# Overview

This is a simple flashcard app for iOS. A user can create a collection of flashcards and name it whatever they'd like. They then can create cards for that collection to use for studying. They have the choice of either studying the entire list, studying by term, or by the description they've entered.

I wanted to learn Swift and how to use other IDEs aside from VSCode. This is my first time using XCode and writing in Swift and I have a lot to learn still. I wanted to help fill the gap in my knowledge that is mobile development as that's only going to continue to be more important.

# Future Work

* I would love to implement more with swipes, perhaps a way to flip the card over with a tap or a swipe. Aside from scrolling, all elements of this app are buttons.
* I have a long way to go towards understanding UI design on mobile. I would like to make apps that have more of a design to them than lists and symbols.
* I couldn't tell if there was an easier way to manage files than the way I found, but I know there are more sustainable ways of doing it. I need to learn more about storage and data management on iOS/Android.
